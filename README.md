### Overview:

In this project, we use MVC architecture to develop the app with Flask as backend server and React as frontend server. The steps to start the backend and frontend servers are described in the README files within `back_end` directory and `front_end` directory.

## Using the app

After starting up the flask and react server, open up the browser and navigate to `http://localhost: 3000` (or whichever port the react server is running at). 

User will be welcomed with a screen of the UMASS Amherst Campus map and a box to enter coordinates. User will input two coordinates and a strategy (`source` and `destination`, (A*, Dijsktra) to the provided box and click `Submit`, the map will display two points on the map indicating the coordinates user has submitted, and the shortest path that connects two points.
